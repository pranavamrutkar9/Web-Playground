# Dynamic-Website-Builder

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. A single `.container` in the HTML is used as a **hidden template**.
2. JavaScript clones this template and injects dynamic data (like title, views, duration, etc.).
3. Thumbnails are added as background images using inline styles.
4. Each card is then appended to a `.cards` wrapper on the page.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout adjusts based on screen size using a media query:
- On smaller screens (`max-width: 550px`), the layout switches from horizontal to vertical for better readability.
